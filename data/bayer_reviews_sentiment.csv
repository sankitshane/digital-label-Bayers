These fertilizer/insect control spikes have made a huge difference in my flower filled urns and hanging plants. You need to use the recommended amount of spikes per pot size to get the amazing results.,Maxforce,Positive/Neutral
Application of this product is a joke!,Insect control plus fertilizer,Negative

live in Florida and my porch plants were all infested with scale. I was basically told that all you can do is physically remove any infestations and pick off what you can....which I did for almost a year! I tried Neem oil treatments other sprays and nothing worked. Tried these and within a few months they are completely cured! Couldn't be happier with this product!,Insect control plus fertilizer,Positive/Neutral
"I found the idea of using an applicator, rather than a hand to push the pill into the dirt was absolutely silly & unnecessary. Not only did it not work, it was too reminiscent of using a tampon and was a bizarre add. Pills don’t disolve with water, are now just sort of sitting in the soil. Seemingly a waste of $.",Insect control plus fertilizer,Negative
I put this BioAdvanced down last fall and this spring and it's the worst stuff I have ever used. I need to buy Scotts now and hope to get rid of all the dandelions and clover out of my lawn. This stuff fed the weeds.,All in one weed and feed,Negative
"I’m not that into grass, and don’t much mind some dandelions, but my yard was nothing but this year in more than a few patches. For neighborly harmony I decided to treat the yard. This stuff worked better than the professional treatment we received by mistake a few years ago. (Company went to the wrong address.) I went over the worst patches twice. No burning, grass is growing in a thick dark green, and the dandelions gone. All of em. The product had smooth consistency, no clumps, and mild odor.",All in one weed and feed,Negative
I have used Maxforce before and this is not the product.... The gel is brown and this one was white.... Not one dead roach with these tubes.... This is definitely not Maxforce.... Won't be purchasing from this seller again.... Don't waste your money like I did.... Look for another Maxforce seller because the product does work....,Maxforce,Negative
After two weeks you no longer see roaches and ants. AMAZING!,Maxforce,Positive/Neutral
The Maxforce Impact roach bait gel has worked well for me in the past. The box I received was manufactured 4 years ago. Amazon needs to discard their expired product instead of selling it,Maxforce,Negative
"Last ;year I had so many Japanize Beetles, I thought we lost the war. I used this product in the spring and its now nearly August and I have not had one beetle on my Birch tree. I have an Ash tree next to my Birch and it also works on the Ash Borer Guy. I will us this EVERY YEAR!!!",Insect control plus fertilizer,Positive/Neutral
This product works great preventing aphids in our birch trees. We have used it for years with great success. I purchased the product without checking other store prices and Lowe's had it for nearly $15 less,Insect control plus fertilizer,Positive/Neutral
